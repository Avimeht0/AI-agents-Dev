# Assignment 1 - Basic Python Concepts

This folder contains two Python programs that demonstrate fundamental Python programming concepts including user input, mathematical operations, string manipulation, and f-string formatting.

## Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations Calculator

**File:** `Task_1.py`

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user
2. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the results of each operation on the screen

### Functionality
- Prompts user to enter two integer numbers
- Performs all four basic arithmetic operations
- Displays results using f-string formatting
- Handles integer input and floating-point division

### Usage
```bash
python Task_1.py
```

### Example Output
```
Enter the first number 10
Enter the second number 5
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 2.0
```

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting Program

**File:** `Task_2.py`

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes a user's first name and last name as input
2. Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name
3. Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name

### Functionality
- Prompts user to enter first and last name separately
- Concatenates the names with a space separator
- Creates a personalized greeting message
- Uses f-string formatting for clean output

### Usage
```bash
python Task_2.py
```

### Example Output
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your second name: Doe
Hello John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
```

## Learning Objectives

These tasks cover the following Python concepts:
- **User Input**: Using `input()` function to get user data
- **Type Conversion**: Converting string input to integers where needed
- **String Operations**: Concatenation and string manipulation
- **Mathematical Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations
- **F-strings**: Modern string formatting for clean output
- **Variable Assignment**: Storing and manipulating data in variables

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+ (for f-string support)
- No additional libraries required

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the Assignment1 directory
2. Run either task using: `python Task_1.py` or `python Task_2.py`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the programs
