# Assignment 2 - Control Structures

Two Python programs demonstrating conditional statements and loops.

## Task 1: Even/Odd Number Checker

**File:** `Task_1.py`

**Problem:** Check if a user-input number is even or odd using if-else statements.

**Usage:** `python Task_1.py`

**Example:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```

## Task 2: Sum Calculator (1 to 50)

**File:** `Task_2.py`

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

**Usage:** `python Task_2.py`

**Example:**
```
The sum of numbers 1 to 50 is: 1275
```

## Concepts Covered
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- For loops with range()
- Modulo operator (%)
- Accumulator pattern
