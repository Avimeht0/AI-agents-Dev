# Assignment 4 - File Handling

Two Python programs demonstrating file operations and error handling.

## Task 1: File Reader with Error Handling

**File:** `Task_1.py`

**Problem:** Read a text file and handle errors if file doesn't exist.

**Usage:** `python Task_1.py`

**Example:**
```
line 1: This is simple text file.
line 2: It contains multiple lines.
```

## Task 2: File Writer and Appender

**File:** `task_2.py`

**Problem:** Write user input to file, append additional data, then read and display content.

**Usage:** `python task_2.py`

**Example:**
```
Enter Text to write to the file: Hello World
Enter additional text to append: This is appended text
Hello World
This is appended text
```

## Files Included
- `simple.txt` - Sample text file for Task 1
- `output.txt` - Generated by Task 2

## Concepts Covered
- File opening modes (read, write, append)
- Error handling with try-except
- File context managers (with statement)
- Line-by-line file reading
