# Assignment 5 - Data Structures

Two Python programs demonstrating dictionary operations and list slicing.

## Task 1: Student Marks Dictionary

**File:** `Task_1.py`

**Problem:** Create a dictionary of student marks and retrieve marks by student name.

**Usage:** `python Task_1.py`

**Example:**
```
Enter the student's name : Arvind
Arvind's marks 90.
```

## Task 2: List Slicing Operations

**File:** `Task_2.py`

**Problem:** Create a list, extract first five elements, and reverse them.

**Usage:** `python Task_2.py`

**Example:**
```
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elemetns: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Concepts Covered
- Dictionary creation and key-value pairs
- Dictionary key checking with `in` operator
- List slicing with `[:5]` and `[::-1]`
- Range function for list generation
- String formatting with f-strings
