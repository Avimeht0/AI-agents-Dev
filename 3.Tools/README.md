# Tools Agent

This directory demonstrates how to create an agent that can use external tools and utilities.

## Contents

### Agent Module
- `tool_agent/` - Agent with tool integration
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization
  - `tool_agent.py` - Agent class with tool capabilities

## Features

- **Tool Integration**: Agent can use external tools and APIs
- **Function Calling**: Ability to call specific functions based on user requests
- **Utility Functions**: Access to various utility functions
- **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Chooses appropriate tools for different tasks

## Usage

1. Import the tool agent:
   ```python
   from tool_agent import tool_agent
   ```

2. Initialize and use the agent:
   ```python
   # Create the agent
   agent = tool_agent.ToolAgent()
   
   # Use with tools
   result = agent.process_request("What's the weather like?")
   ```

## Available Tools

The agent can access various tools including:
- Web search capabilities
- Calculator functions
- File operations
- Data processing utilities
- API integrations

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding tool integration in AI agents
- Implementing function calling mechanisms
- Building extensible agent architectures
- Working with external APIs and utilities
